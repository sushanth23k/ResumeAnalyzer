    Requirements for the bullet points:
    1. Use the structure: What + How + Why/Impact (except the first bullet, which is a simple, high-level summary).
    2. The first bullet for each experience should be a clear summary of the experience should be presented as a resume work experience bullet point.
    3. Aggressively incorporate relevant keywords and skills from the job description to maximize ATS scoring, but only where they make sense.
    4. Do not repeat any single skill more than 4 times across all experiences.
    5. Each bullet point must contain at least 25-30 words.
    6. Include clear, quantifiable outcomes or improvements (numbers, percentages, time saved, revenue impact, scale, reliability, etc.).
    7. Explicitly optimize content for ATS keyword filtering and recruiter readability (concise, impact-focused, no fluff).
    8. Add missing but relevant skills/tools from the job description by credibly mapping them onto the candidate's existing responsibilities and projects.
    9. Generate exactly the number of bullet points specified in the "resume_points" field for each experience—no more, no less.
    10. Follow professional resume style with strong action verbs, quantifiable metrics, and business impact.
    11. Keep the word count of all bullet points within a tight, consistent range (same rough length for every bullet).
    12. IMPORTANT: Creatively adapt and enhance the work experience to match job requirements, even if certain technologies or responsibilities were not explicitly mentioned originally.
    13. Strategically weave in missing job requirements by reframing existing work to demonstrate the relevant skills, tools, and ownership.
    14. Transform generic tasks into role-specific, outcome-driven achievements aligned to the target job.
    15. CRITICAL: Preserve the core project use cases and business contexts from the original experience (for example, drive-thru platforms, data processing workflows, metadata crawlers). Do NOT invent completely new projects.
    16. Always build on the existing project explanations instead of replacing them, enhancing them with job-relevant technologies, methodologies, and responsibilities.

    Example bullet format:
    • Modernized HSBC's customer profile system by refactoring monolithic bottlenecks into autonomous Java Spring Boot microservices with REST APIs, improving resiliency and reducing downtime by 30% through circuit breaker patterns.
    • Migrated a legacy mainframe database to cloud-native AWS S3 and CockroachDB (NoSQL) with near-zero downtime, ensuring 99% data integrity via Java-based batch validations and automated health checks.

    Output format (valid JSON only):
    [{{
        "experience_id": "experience_id_from_input",
        "experience_role": "role_from_input",
        "resume_points": ["bullet_point_1", "bullet_point_2", "bullet_point_3", ...]
    }}]

    You MUST:
    - Return only JSON in the exact format shown above (no extra commentary, no markdown, no explanations).
    - Ensure the number of bullet points for each experience exactly matches its "resume_points" value.
    - Ensure the final bullets would make a recruiter for the target role confident enough to move this candidate to the interview stage and that the resume will pass ATS filters for this job.

        {additional_instruction_text}
        
        CORE REQUIREMENTS:
        1. PRIMARY FOCUS: Job description keywords and existing skills alignment
        2. PRESERVE all existing skills that match job requirements - DO NOT REMOVE them
        3. ADD missing critical skills from job description using exact keyword matching
        4. Experience/Projects: Use ONLY for validation - ensure skills mentioned there are included if job-relevant
        5. Use SPECIFIC tool names only - NO generic terms
        6. Each skill category should be 100-120 characters total (including category name and all skills)

        CHARACTER COUNT CONSTRAINT:
        - Each skill_category + skills combined should be approximately 100-120 characters
        - Prioritize most important skills if character limit is reached
        - Example: "Programming Languages" + ["Java", "Python", "SQL"] = ~50 chars, add more skills to reach 100-120

        FORBIDDEN GENERIC TERMS (NEVER USE):
        - "Microservices Architecture" → Use "Spring Boot", "Node.js", "Django"
        - "Relational Databases" → Use "PostgreSQL", "MySQL", "SQL Server"
        - "Infrastructure as Code" → Use "Terraform", "CloudFormation", "Ansible"
        - "NoSQL Databases" → Use "MongoDB", "DynamoDB", "Cosmos DB"
        - "Container Orchestration" → Use "Kubernetes", "Docker Swarm"
        - "CI/CD" → Use "Jenkins", "GitLab CI", "GitHub Actions"

        SPECIFIC SKILL CATEGORIES AND EXAMPLES:
        - Programming Languages: Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, C++, Go
        - Web Frameworks: Spring Boot, ReactJS, Node.js, Django, Flask, Angular
        - Database Management: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, DynamoDB, Pinecone
        - Cloud Technologies: 
          * AWS: Lambda, S3, EC2, RDS, Kinesis, SQS, CloudFormation, ECS
          * Azure: Functions, Blob Storage, Cosmos DB, Service Bus, Logic Apps
          * GCP: Cloud Functions, Pub/Sub, BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Cloud Run
        - DevOps Tools: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Jenkins, GitLab CI
        - Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, LangChain, Pinecone
        - Monitoring: Splunk, Grafana, Prometheus, New Relic, Datadog

        CLOUD PLATFORM DETECTION RULES:
        - If job description mentions "AWS" or AWS services → Use AWS-specific tools
        - If job description mentions "Azure" → Use Azure-specific tools  
        - If job description mentions "GCP"/"Google Cloud" → Use GCP-specific tools
        - If multiple clouds mentioned → Use the most frequently mentioned one
        - If no cloud mentioned → Use cloud tools from existing skills

        ATS OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY:
        1. KEYWORD MATCHING: Extract exact keywords from job description
        2. PRIORITIZE JOB-RELEVANT SKILLS: Job description skills appear first in categories
        3. TECHNOLOGY CONSISTENCY: Use specific tool names from experience/projects
        4. DEPTH OVER BREADTH: Fewer, well-evidenced skills over many unsubstantiated ones
        5. MAINTAIN TECHNICAL CREDIBILITY: All skills must be defensible

        SKILL VALIDATION (Secondary Priority):
        - If skill in experience/projects AND job-relevant → MUST include
        - If skill in current_skills AND job-relevant → MUST preserve
        - Add job description skills only if they complement existing expertise""" + """

        OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only):
